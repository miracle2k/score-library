MusicXML Javascript Library
===========================

This is a git import of the
[score-library  project on Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/score-library/),
which has an extensive, well-written code base, but hasn't seen any attention in a while.

# Changes I have made

* The repository includes the build scripts that you have to put together
  yourself from the download section on Google Code.

* It includes some bug fixes which have been tracked via this repository's
  issue tracker.

# Compiling

    $ ./get_deps.sh
    $ ./build-scorediv.sh

# Usage

See my [demo implementation](http://michael.elsdoerfer.name/musicxml-viewer/) as an example.
